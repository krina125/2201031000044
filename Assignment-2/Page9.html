        <p class="history">Ahmedabad is the largest city
            in the state of Gujarat. It is located
            in western India on the banks of
            the River Sabarmati. The present
            city was founded on 26 February
            1411 and announced as the capital
            on 4 March 1411 by Ahmed Shah I.
            For next 135 years(1572-1707), the
            city renewed greatness under the
            early rulers of Mughal Empire.
            The city again progressed when
            politically stabilized when British
            East India Company established
            the rule in the city (1818–1857).
            When Gujarat was carved out in
            1960, it again became the capital
            of the state until establishment
            of Gandhinagar in 1965.
            Ahmedabad is also the cultural
            and economical centre of Gujarat
            and the seventh largest city of
            India.</p>
